      <h3>What is MiOncoCirc? </h3>
      <p style="font-size:90%;text-align:justify"><b>MiOncoCirc</b> is the first extensive clinical, cancer-centric resource of circRNAs. Most importantly, our database has been largely constructed from clinical cancer samples (2,000+) across a plethora of disease sites, while other resources have characterized circRNAs from cancer cell lines. The transcriptional processes, and resulting circRNA formation, that occur in a dish versus a native tumor microenvironment will undoubtedly be vastly different, making MiOncoCirc a better representation of the true circRNA profile associated with cancer. Furthermore, <b>MiOncoCirc</b> represents a rich resource containing circRNAs from primary tumors, metastases, and very rare cancer types, novel features compared to the other databases. Researchers who are interested can also query mutations and copy-number since MiOncoCirc samples are collected from previously published genomic papers (Mody et al., 2015, Robinson et al., 2015, and Robinson et al., 2017).</p>
